Implementation of Neural Networks to classify MNIST dataset.

The first version is a raw implementation using Mean Squared error.

The second version implements Cross entropy as the loss function, L2 regularization, early stopping and a better initialization of weights.

The best accuracies I got were 90.22% for the first version and 94.3% for the second version. I didn't try to adjust the hyperparameters all that much so the accuracy has some room for improvement.
